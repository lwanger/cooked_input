Cooked Input Project
====================


``cooked_input`` is a Python package for getting, cleaning, converting, and validating input. 
If you think of input (raw_input in legacy Python) as raw input, then this is cooked input.

``cooked_input`` provides a simple and safe way to get validated command line input that ranges from the simplest
of Python programs to sophisticated database driven applications. Beginner's can use the provided convenience classes
to get simple inputs from the user. Following the `tutorial < http://cooked-input.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>
you can be up and running in minutes.

 More advanced users can easily create custom classes for sophisticated cleaning and validation. ``Cooked_input`` can
 also be used to create menus and data tables. The latter tutorials and examples show several examples ranging from
 simple to sophisticated calls.

 ``Cooked_input`` also provides a pathway to use the same cleaning and validation logic used in the command line
 for validating web or GUI based inputs.
