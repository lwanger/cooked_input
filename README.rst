Cooked Input Project
====================

``cooked_input`` is a Python package for getting, cleaning, converting, and validating input.
If you think of input (raw_input in legacy Python) as raw input, then this is cooked input.

``cooked_input`` provides a simple and safe way to get validated text-based input ranging from the simplest
of Python programs to sophisticated database driven applications. Beginner's can use the provided convenience classes
to get simple inputs from the user. Following the `tutorial <http://cooked-input.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_
you can be up and running in minutes.

More advanced users can use the wide array of supplied cleaners, convertors and validators to process more complex inputs or
create custom classes for sophisticated cleaning and validation.  The tutorials and examples show several examples ranging 
from simple to sophisticated calls.

``Cooked_input`` also provides a pathway to use the same cleaning and validation logic used for text-based input for
for validating web or GUI-based inputs.

``Cooked_input`` can also be used with its sister package `cooked_table <http://cooked-table.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to create menus and data tables.
